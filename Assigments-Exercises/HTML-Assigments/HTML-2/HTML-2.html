    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hiii!! My name is Maeryl B. Venida from BSCPE 1-3. I am 19 years old and will be turning 20 this year.
        <br>Actually 2nd year na dapat ako, but since I shifted courses, I am now an Irregular First Year.
        <br>I don't have any prior experiences when it comes to coding and programming, so please bear with me TwT.
        <br>Looking forward to learning new things and meeting people along the way! 

    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Isa sa mga hobbies ko is playing games, mainly genshin and honkai: star rail. I also enjoy reading mangas 
        <br>and watching anime, but due to hectic sched and heavy workloads, minsan ko na lang sya nagagawa. 
        <br>Even though I am a "stay at home" enthusiast, I still enjoy going out and doing physical activites (pathfit things). 
        <br>It's nice to go on long walks from time to time because it helps me clear my mind and it allows me to become familiar with the place.
